# Music-Instrument-Classification Project

This repository contains **python ml model** for recognising musical instruments from short instrument audio clips.  

| Approach | Core Idea | Toolchain |
|----------|-----------|-----------|

| **Python / ML** | Learn features end-to-end from log-Mel spectrograms using a lightweight CNN trained with PyTorch, accelerated on GPU + AMP. | Python 3.9 â€“ 3.12, PyTorch 2.x |

---

The project is intentionally structured so you can **swap datasets** and **replicate experiments** quickly in either branch, then compare accuracy, training time, and interpretability.
